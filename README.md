This project focuses on time series analysis of stock prices using Python. The workflow includes loading and cleaning historical stock data, visualizing trends through line plots, and resampling data to monthly averages. Seasonality is examined using Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plots, while stationarity is tested with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. To prepare the data for forecasting, techniques like differencing and moving averages are applied for smoothing and trend removal. Finally, the stationarity of the transformed data is re-validated with the ADF test, ensuring the series is ready for future forecasting applications.
